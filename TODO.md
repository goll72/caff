 - [ ] Implement timeout when clicking on the quick settings
       tile to toggle caffeine rather than cycling through
       durations

 - [ ] Allow adding custom durations/removing existing ones;
       requires persistence (e.g. serialize to JSON file)

 - [ ] Change sleep interval dynamically in `CaffeineService`
       to improve battery usage (impact hasn't been measured)
